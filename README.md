# Weather request

#### This is an app for weather request, continuing with my learning of API

1) Insert the city of interest
2) Pick from the available countries
3) Submit

There is a form validation, so all fields must be completed. And if you try searching for a non-existent city, then a error messagge is going to appear. This is a very simple project, just to test an API with credentials.
